# ðŸ¥Š Junior Researcher Starter Pack

You may find this whole repo useful. But I decided to consolidate all the most important rules/habits here as a starter pack for junior researchers. If I fail to obey them, criticize me.

## 1. Take notes of meetings and tasks. 
If something is not put down in notes, it didn't happen.

## 2. If one got to learn something, one should be able to teach everyone else. 
Otherwise, one fails to master it. There is a saying that goes like "see one, do one, teach one".

## 3. Shared code must be under version control.
Any code without version control is a corpus. You may find the resources below useful:

## 4. Ask for whatever you need in a timely manner.
This usually happens when you are at the start of a project or you encounter some problems. The more you ask, the more you get. The earlier you ask, the earlier we solve the problem. What does that mean? Longer vacations : )

## 5. Dissent is an obligation.
Following the last rule, communication is everyone's obligation. And specifically, I value my colleagues who point out others' mistakes. A capable researcher makes an analysis of his own.
