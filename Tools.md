##### Set up Docker on Linux OS

1. Download the latest DEB package. (You can check the detail in [Website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/))

2. For non-Gnome Desktop environments, ```gnome-terminal``` must be installed:
    ```
    sudo apt install gnome-terminal
    ```

3. Uninstall the tech preview or beta version of Docker Desktop for Linux. Run:
    ```
    sudo apt remove docker-desktop
    ```

4. For a complete cleanup, remove configuration and data files at ```$HOME/.docker/desktop```, the symlink at ```/usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli```, and purge the remaining systemd service files.
    ```
    rm -r $HOME/.docker/desktop
    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/com.docker.cli
    sudo apt purge docker-desktop
    ```

5. Set up Docker‚Äôs package repository. (**this step is indispensable.**)
    ```
    sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt update -y
    ```

6. Install the package
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.deb
    ```

7. Check Docker's version
    ```
    docker --version
    ```

##### How to delete docker's image

1. check the docker's images and find the target image ID (front 3 words is okay).
    ```
    docker images
    ```
2. try to delete the image (e.g. ```eca```)
    ```
    docker rmi eca
    ```
3. usually, the image couldn't be deleted directly. you need to delete the container first.

   check all containers.
   ```
   docker ps -a
   ```
   find the target container ID, front 3 words is okay. (e.g. ```39a```)

   stop the container (if it's running).
   ```
   docker stop 39a
   ```
   delete the container.
   ```
   docker rm 39a
   ```
4. then, delete the image.
   ```
   docker rmi eca
   ```
